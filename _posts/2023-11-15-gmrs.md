## GMRS

<p>I was driving into work this morning, and found myself behind a civilian pickup truck (generic Connecticut combination plates and no business markings) sporting what looked like either a UHF-gain or dual-band VHF/UHF antenna permanantly mounted on the roof. This was unusual because in this area you don't see too many civilian vehicles sporting antennas. As I continued to drive behind the vehicle, I noticed a sticker on the rear window marked "GMRS 462.675" telling me the driver was a General Mobile Radio Service user and was allegedly active on 462.675 Mhz. which is the frequency of the calling/road/emergency channel for GMRS.</p>

<p>GMRS popularity is increasing in this area because it emables an entire family to operate under a single license, and requires no testing. Radios are reaonsbly priced, and the equipment is pretty bulletproff for the non-techncial operator as compaired to Amateur Radio.</p>
